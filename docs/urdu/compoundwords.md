title: Compound Words in Urdu
---
There are many words in urdu that seem to be composed of other words. For many of these words, urdu speakers don't seem to be aware of the fact that they are compound words when I bring it up. It rarely crosses my mind for the majority of the words as well. Here are a few I have recognized.

- salgira (birthday) -> sal (year) gira (dropped) -> year of being dropped
- jahnamaz (prayer mat) -> jha (where) namaz (prayer) -> place of prayer
- khubsurat (beautiful) -> khoob (amazing, very good) surat (face, appearance)

khubsurat I recognized in the writing of this article, by remembering khub means good and looking for a translation of surat.
